# recommendations
The following repository was created for a class on Recommendation Engines. Over the course of the term, three different recommendation/filtering engines were created (code, HTML file, and datasets are provided for each one):

(1) Annie_Pi_exerciseCF: Notebook created in R using MovieLens datasets to develop a collaborative filtering engine based on user similarity using Pearson Correlation and weighted averages.

(2) Annie_Pi_exerciseNP: Notebook created in R using Movielens datasets to develop a non-personalized filtering engine based on mean ratings, quantity of ratings, association analysis, etc. 

(3) Annie_Pi_exerciseCBF: Notebook created in Python using Quora datasets to develop a content-based filtering engine to predict user preferences based on question topics and user actions on each question.
